This version is a fork of the original code for ALERT project.
The original project can be found in http://metricsgrimoire.github.com/CVSAnalY/

 Download
----------

 * git://github.com/AlertProject/CVSAnalY.git
 * https://github.com/AlertProject/CVSAnalY.git


 Requirements
--------------

CVSAnalY has the following dependencies:

    * RepositoryHandler
        git clone git://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/RepositoryHandler.git
    * cvs (optional, for CVS support)
    * subversion (optional, for SVN support)
    * git (optional, for Git support)
    * Python MySQLDB (optional but recommended)
    * Python SQLite (optional)


 Installation
--------------

You can install cvsanaly2 just by running setup.py script:

    # python setup.py install

This will install it in the python default directories in your system.

If you don't install CVSAnalY with root privileges, or don't want
to install it in the default directories, you can also use the source
code directory, as cloned from the main git repo. It is enough to
configure your PATH and PYTHONPATH so that cvsanaly2, and the Python
modules it needs, are found.

Add to your $PATH the directory which contains cvsanaly
(cvsanalydir is the directory where CVSAnalY is installed):

    $ export PATH=$PATH:cvsanalydir

In PYHTONPATH, you need to include both the dirs for CVSAnalY and
RepositoryHandler (except if it is installed in the default Python dirs
in your system). If repohandlerdir is the path where RepositoryHandler
is installed:

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:cvsanalydir:repohandlerdir

You are ready to use cvsanaly2!


 Running cvsanaly2
-------------------

For the impatients: just checkout (from svn or cvs) to obtain a local
version of your repository, and then run cvsanaly2:

    $ cd project/
    ~/project$ cvsanaly2

More options, and a more detailed info about the options, can be
learnt by running "cvsanaly2 --help"

CVSAnalY was initially developed by the GSyC/LibreSoft group at the
Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid (Spain). It is
part of a wider research on libre software engineering, aimed to gain
knowledge on how libre software is developed and maintained.
